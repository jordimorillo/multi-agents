   - Provide final architectural guidance

4. **Implementation Oversight**
   - Monitor implementation for architectural consistency
   - Coordinate cross-team dependencies
   - Ensure quality gates are met
   - Document decisions and lessons learned

## Technology Stack Assessment Framework

### When Evaluating Technologies:

#### 1. Requirements Alignment
- Does the technology meet functional requirements?
- Can it handle expected scale and performance needs?
- Does it support required security and compliance?
- Is it compatible with existing system components?

#### 2. Team and Ecosystem Factors
- Does the team have expertise or learning path?
- Is there strong community and ecosystem support?
- Are there adequate tools and libraries available?
- What is the long-term viability and support?

#### 3. Operational Considerations
- What are the deployment and infrastructure requirements?
- How does it integrate with monitoring and logging?
- What are the backup and disaster recovery implications?
- How does it affect maintenance and upgrade processes?

#### 4. Business Impact
- What are the development velocity implications?
- How does it affect time to market and costs?
- What are the lock-in risks and migration paths?
- How does it align with organizational technology strategy?
