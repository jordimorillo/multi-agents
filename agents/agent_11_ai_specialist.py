ML Feasibility Assessment: {problem}

ü§î Problem Analysis:

Type: Classification/Prediction
Complexity: Medium
Data requirement: 10,000+ labeled examples

‚úÖ ML IS APPROPRIATE:

Reasons:
1. Pattern recognition needed (ML excels here)
2. Rules-based approach would be too complex
3. Large dataset available
4. Performance improves with data

‚ö†Ô∏è  CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Data Availability
   - Need: 10,000+ examples
   - Current: Unknown
   - Action: Audit existing data

2. Labeling Effort
   - Cost: $5-10 per label (if outsourced)
   - Time: 2-3 weeks
   - Alternative: Active learning to reduce labels

3. Model Complexity
   - Start: Simple (Logistic Regression)
   - Then: Medium (Random Forest)
   - Finally: Complex (Neural Network) if needed

4. Latency Requirements
   - Need: < 100ms
   - Achievable: Yes, with proper optimization

üìä Recommended Approach:

Phase 1: Baseline (Week 1-2)
- Simple ML model (Logistic Regression)
- Quick to train, fast inference
- Establishes performance baseline
- Expected accuracy: 70-75%

Phase 2: Improvement (Week 3-4)
- Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- Feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Expected accuracy: 80-85%

Phase 3: Advanced (Week 5-6, optional)
- Neural network or transformer
- If baseline insufficient
- Expected accuracy: 85-90%

üéØ Success Metrics:

Primary: Accuracy > 85%
Secondary: Precision > 80%, Recall > 80%
Latency: < 100ms p95
Cost: < $0.01 per prediction

üí∞ Cost Estimate:

Development:
- Data labeling: $5,000-10,000
- ML engineer time: 6 weeks
- Training compute: $500-1,000

Production (monthly):
- Inference compute: $200-500
- Model monitoring: $100
- Retraining: $200

Total initial: $15,000-20,000
Total monthly: $500-800

üö¶ Recommendation:

‚úÖ PROCEED with ML approach

Confidence: HIGH
ROI: Expected positive within 6 months
Risk: LOW (can fall back to rules-based)

Alternative if ML fails:
- Hybrid: ML + rules-based
- Use LLM (GPT-4) with few-shot prompting

LLM Integration Design: {use_case}

üéØ Use Case Analysis:

Task: Content generation / Q&A / Classification
Volume: 10,000 requests/day
Latency: < 2 seconds
Quality: High accuracy required

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Options:

Option 1: Direct API Calls (Simple)
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="...")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    temperature=0.2
)
```

Pros: Quick to implement, latest models
Cons: Higher cost, external dependency
Cost: ~$500-1,000/month

Option 2: RAG System (Recommended)
```python
# 1. Build knowledge base
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()
)

# 2. Retrieval + Generation
def query_with_rag(question):
    # Retrieve relevant context
    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question, k=3)
    context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
    
    # Generate answer with context
    prompt = f\"\"\"Context: {context}
    
    Question: {question}
    
    Answer based on the context above:\"\"\"
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

Pros: Grounded in your data, cheaper model
Cons: More complex setup
Cost: ~$200-400/month

Option 3: Fine-tuned Model (Advanced)
```python
# Fine-tune on your data
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file="file-xyz",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
)

# Use fine-tuned model
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:org:name:id",
    messages=[...]
)
```

Pros: Best for your domain, consistent behavior
Cons: Training time, data requirements
Cost: Training $200 + $100-300/month inference

üéØ RECOMMENDATION: Option 2 (RAG)

Why:
1. Best accuracy for domain-specific questions
2. Reasonable cost
3. Transparent (can see sources)
4. Can use cheaper models (gpt-4o-mini)

üì¶ Implementation:

Week 1: Setup
- Choose vector DB (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Prepare and chunk documents
- Generate embeddings

Week 2: Integration
- Build retrieval system
- Implement prompt templates
- Add caching layer

Week 3: Optimization
- Tune retrieval (chunk size, k value)
- Optimize prompts
- Add error handling

Week 4: Production
- Deploy with proper monitoring
- Set up rate limiting
- Add fallback logic

üîß Optimization Strategies:

1. Prompt Engineering
```python
system_prompt = \"\"\"You are an expert assistant. 
Follow these rules:
1. Be concise (max 3 paragraphs)
2. Cite sources when possible
3. If unsure, say "I don't know"
4. Use bullet points for lists

Context information:
{context}

User question: {question}\"\"\"
```

2. Caching
```python
import redis

cache = redis.Redis()

def cached_query(question):
    # Check cache first
    cached = cache.get(f"llm:{question}")
    if cached:
        return cached.decode()
    
    # Generate if not cached
    result = query_with_rag(question)
    cache.setex(f"llm:{question}", 3600, result)
    return result
```

3. Fallback Strategy
```python
def query_with_fallback(question):
    try:
        # Try primary model (gpt-4o)
        return query_gpt4(question)
    except RateLimitError:
        # Fall back to gpt-3.5
        return query_gpt35(question)
    except Exception:
        # Final fallback: pre-defined response
        return "I'm having trouble right now. Please try again."
```

üìä Monitoring:

Track:
- Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Cost per request
- Error rate
- User satisfaction (thumbs up/down)
- Token usage

Alerts:
- Latency > 5 seconds
- Cost > budget
- Error rate > 5%

üí∞ Cost Optimization:

1. Use gpt-4o-mini for simple queries (10x cheaper)
2. Implement caching (50% hit rate = 50% cost reduction)
3. Batch requests when possible
4. Set max_tokens limit
5. Use streaming for long responses

Expected savings: 60-70%

üéØ Success Metrics:

- Response quality: >90% user satisfaction
- Latency: <2s p95
- Uptime: 99.9%
- Cost: <$0.05 per query

Risk: LOW
Confidence: HIGH
Timeline: 4 weeks to production

# Step 1: Extract key terms
terms = llm.generate("Extract technical terms from: {text}")

# Step 2: Translate with context
translation = llm.generate(
    f"Translate '{text}' to Spanish. Key terms: {terms}"
